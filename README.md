Smarter Flair Vents custom integration (work in progress).

This integration targets Flair Smart Vents and Pucks with optional Dynamic Airflow
Balancing (DAB). Configuration is handled via the UI config flow and options flow.

## Efficiency visualization (HA)

To mirror Hubitat's "Discovered devices" efficiency list, the integration exposes
two extra sensors per vent:

- `<vent name> Cooling Efficiency` (%)
- `<vent name> Heating Efficiency` (%)

These are derived from the learned DAB rates and shown as percentages (0-100). A
value of `unknown` means the rate has not been learned yet.

Example Lovelace table (adjust entity_ids to match your vents):

```yaml
type: entities
title: Vent Efficiency
entities:
  - entity: sensor.tomas_1222_cooling_efficiency
    name: Tomas Cooling
  - entity: sensor.tomas_1222_heating_efficiency
    name: Tomas Heating
  - entity: sensor.master_bedroom_cooling_efficiency
    name: Master Bedroom Cooling
  - entity: sensor.master_bedroom_heating_efficiency
    name: Master Bedroom Heating
```

Below is a thorough feature inventory derived from the Hubitat implementation that
we are porting. It is grouped into functional features and non-functional behaviors.

## Configuration guide (user-friendly)

### Initial setup (Config Flow)
When you add the integration:
- **Client ID / Client Secret**: OAuth 2.0 credentials from your Flair developer app.
  - Must be a **Client Credentials** app (not password login).
  - If you see `invalid_scope`, your app is missing requested scopes; see Troubleshooting.
- **Structure selection** (if you have multiple homes): choose which structure to manage.

### Options (Options Flow)

**Algorithm & Polling Settings**
- **Use Dynamic Airflow Balancing (DAB)**: Enables the adaptive vent‑balancing algorithm.
  - If disabled, vents are not automatically adjusted by the integration.
- **Force structure mode to manual**: When DAB is enabled, force Flair structure mode to
  `manual` to allow vent control. Disable if you prefer to keep Flair in `auto` and
  understand that DAB may not work reliably.
- **Close vents in inactive rooms**: If enabled, DAB will close vents for rooms marked
  inactive (Flair “away” rooms).
- **Vent adjustment granularity (%)**: Rounds vent changes to a set increment (5/10/25/50/100).
  - Smaller values = finer control, more frequent adjustments.
  - Larger values = fewer adjustments, less vent wear.
- **Polling interval (active HVAC)**: How often data is refreshed while heating/cooling.
- **Polling interval (idle HVAC)**: How often data is refreshed while idle.
- **Initial efficiency percent**: Starting efficiency value used until real rates are learned.
- **Notify on efficiency adjustments**: Optional HA notification whenever DAB updates a room’s efficiency.
- **Log efficiency adjustments**: Add an entry to the Logbook whenever efficiency changes.

**Vent Assignments**
- **Thermostat per vent**: Each vent must be mapped to the thermostat that controls the
  HVAC serving that room.
- **Optional temperature sensor per vent**: Overrides Flair room temperature with a
  specific HA sensor (e.g., room sensor).

**Conventional Vent Counts**
- **Conventional vents per thermostat**: Number of non‑Flair (standard) vents on that HVAC
  system. Used to prevent total airflow from dropping too low when DAB closes vents.

## Services

- `smarter_flair_vents.set_room_active`: Set a room to active/inactive by room_id or vent_id.
- `smarter_flair_vents.set_room_setpoint`: Set room setpoint (C) by room_id or vent_id.
- `smarter_flair_vents.set_structure_mode`: Force structure mode `auto`/`manual`.
- `smarter_flair_vents.run_dab`: Manually trigger a DAB run (optional thermostat filter).
- `smarter_flair_vents.refresh_devices`: Force a refresh (useful after adding hardware).
- `smarter_flair_vents.export_efficiency`: Export learned efficiency to a JSON file.
  - `efficiency_path` is optional (defaults to `smarter_flair_vents_efficiency_export_<entry>.json`).
  - Path must be under your HA config directory.
- `smarter_flair_vents.import_efficiency`: Import learned efficiency from a JSON file.
  - Use either `efficiency_path` (file under your HA config directory),
    `efficiency_payload` (inline JSON), or pass `exportMetadata` + `efficiencyData`
    directly in the service call.
  - Supports Hubitat's export format (roomId/roomName/ventId rates).

## Troubleshooting

**Config flow error: `cannot_connect`**
- Usually indicates an auth or network issue. Check:
  - Client ID/secret are correct and have no extra spaces.
  - Your HA instance can reach `https://api.flair.co`.
  - OAuth app is **client_credentials**.

**Auth error: `invalid_scope`**
- Your Flair app does not have all requested scopes.
- The integration will fall back to a reduced scope set, but some features
  (room setpoint/active) may be limited.
- Ask Flair to enable the missing scopes for your OAuth app if needed.

**DAB not adjusting vents**
- Confirm DAB is enabled in options.
- Ensure each vent has a thermostat assignment.
- Verify HVAC action is `heating` or `cooling` in the thermostat entity.

**Efficiency sensors show `unknown`**
- DAB learns rates after full HVAC cycles. Values appear after a few heating/cooling
  runs when the algorithm can compute room efficiency.

## Integration tests (PHACC)

We support a lightweight integration test suite using
`pytest-homeassistant-custom-component` (PHACC).

1) Install PHACC in your virtualenv:
```
pip install pytest-homeassistant-custom-component
```

2) Run the integration tests:
```
pytest -q config/custom_components/smarter_flair_vents/tests_integration
```

## Manual refresh (optional)

A lightweight service is available to force a refresh if you add/rename devices
and want them to appear immediately:

```
service: smarter_flair_vents.refresh_devices
```

## Functional features (Hubitat baseline)

### Authentication & API access
- OAuth 2.0 client-credentials authentication against `https://api.flair.co`.
- Token refresh and re-auth on 401/403 responses.
- Support for structures, vents, pucks, rooms, and remote sensors endpoints.

### Discovery & device model
- Discover structures and select a structure for control.
- Discover vents and pucks:
  - Primary: `/structures/{id}/vents`, `/structures/{id}/pucks`.
  - Fallback: `/rooms?include=pucks` and `/pucks` (Hubitat used both).
- Map to device entities:
  - Vents: percent-open control + readings.
  - Pucks: temperature, humidity, battery, motion/occupancy, signal metrics.

### Vent data & control
- Read vent attributes: percent-open, duct temperature, duct pressure, voltage, RSSI.
- Set vent position (0–100%).
- Maintain unique IDs, names, and per-vent state.
- Expose room metadata on vent entities (room id, name, setpoint, occupancy, etc.).

### Puck data & sensors
- Read puck attributes: temperature, humidity, battery, voltage, RSSI, firmware, status.
- Expose puck motion/occupancy (binary sensor) and signal metrics.
- Expose room metadata on puck entities.

### Room controls
- Set room `active` flag (home/away equivalent).
- Set room setpoint in Celsius with optional hold-until timestamp.
- Read room state, occupancy mode, and associated metadata.

### Structure controls
- Set structure mode (auto/manual) as required by the DAB logic.

### Dynamic Airflow Balancing (DAB)
- Optional algorithm that adjusts vent openings based on:
  - Thermostat HVAC state (heating/cooling/idle).
  - Thermostat setpoints.
  - Room temperatures (via Flair rooms or per-vent temp sensors).
  - Learned room efficiency rates (heating and cooling).
- Pre-adjustment logic when approaching setpoints.
- Learned efficiency computation after HVAC cycle completes.
- Vent opening calculation using learned efficiency and target time-to-setpoint.
- Minimum airflow protection using conventional vent count and iterative increments.
- Rebalancing during active HVAC cycles when rooms reach setpoints.

### Polling & updates
- Dynamic polling interval based on HVAC state:
  - Active HVAC: fast refresh (Hubitat used 3 min).
  - Idle HVAC: slower refresh (Hubitat used 10 min).
- Per-device refresh scheduling and state updates.

### Efficiency export/import (Hubitat only)
- JSON export of learned efficiency data (rates per room).
- JSON import with validation and matching by room ID or name.

## Non-functional behaviors (Hubitat baseline)

### Performance & concurrency
- Throttling for API calls to avoid rate limits:
  - Max concurrent requests (Hubitat used 8).
  - Delay/retry when throttled (Hubitat used 3s).
- Retry logic with capped attempts (Hubitat used 5).

### Caching
- Short-lived caches for room and device readings (Hubitat used ~30s).
- LRU eviction and periodic cleanup tasks.
- Pending-request tracking to prevent duplicate API calls.

### Resilience & error handling
- Treat 401/403 as auth failures and re-auth automatically.
- Log and skip 404s for missing pucks/sensors rather than failing.
- Handle occasional hub load exceptions without breaking the flow.

### Scheduling & timing
- Periodic cleanup tasks for caches and pending flags.
- HVAC state change listeners to switch polling strategy.

### Data storage
- Token and cached state stored per integration instance.
- Efficiency data persisted to storage for reuse across restarts.

### Observability
- Multiple debug levels in Hubitat (0–3).
- Structured logs for API errors, retries, and DAB decisions.

## Porting parity notes
- The list above is the baseline feature inventory from Hubitat.
- Some items are intentionally optional or deferred in the HA port
  (e.g., efficiency export/import).
- Use this list as the checklist for “feature-complete” parity.
